# Game of Life in Lua

This is a Lua-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 

The project generates a grid universe where cells evolve over time based on specific rules for survival, reproduction, and death.

## More Info

This is a 1 to 1 recreation of another project of mine. I learned a lot of Go when I made it, so this is to teach myself lua.
